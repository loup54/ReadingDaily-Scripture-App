## How to Use These Documents

### When Phase 8 Goes Live:
1. Deploy to App Store ✅
2. Monitor for 4 weeks (Phase 8A)
3. Start reviewing `DETAILED_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_8A_TO_9.3.md` at week 4

### At Week 4-6 Post-Launch:
1. Execute Phase 8A monitoring (follow the guide)
2. Collect data and user feedback
3. Generate Phase 8A reports
4. Use data to confirm Phase 9 priorities

### At Week 5-7 Post-Launch:
1. Begin Phase 8B design documentation
2. Use `VISUAL_HIERARCHY_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` as reference
3. Create brand kit and component specifications
4. Prepare for Phase 9 implementation

### At Week 8+ Post-Launch:
1. Execute Phase 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 using detailed specifications
2. Deploy incrementally
3. Measure results
4. Iterate based on user feedback
