### Psychology & Spiritual Association

**Psychological Impact:**

- **Heaven/Divine** - Blue sky represents transcendence
- **Faith** - Associated with spiritual trust
- **Contemplation** - Invites inward reflection
- **Ecclesiastical** - Used in church vestments and tradition

**NOT chosen because:**
- ❌ Tech companies use blue (wrong reason)
- ❌ It's popular in app stores (wrong reason)
- ❌ Contrast against white (just technical)

**Chosen because:**
- ✅ Reflects spiritual authority and depth
- ✅ Conveys reverence and trustworthiness
- ✅ Psychologically supports contemplation
- ✅ Ecclesiastical tradition (Marian)
- ✅ Premium, intentional, not tech-default

  (Does it evoke the right emotion?)

✓ Accessible?
  (Does it meet WCAG AA contrast requirements?)

If NO to any: Don't use that color choice
If YES to all: Proceed with confidence
```

## Common Color Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: Use pure black (#000000) for text
**Why:** Too harsh, reduces readability, not contemplative
**Instead:** Use #1A1A1A (very dark gray)

### ❌ DON'T: Use pure white (#FFFFFF) text on dark backgrounds
**Why:** Eye strain, too harsh for dark mode
**Instead:** Use #F5F5F5 (off-white) on dark backgrounds

### ❌ DON'T: Over-colorize
**Why:** Too many colors dilutes brand, creates chaos
**Instead:** Use blue/purple 80%, green/red 20%

### ❌ DON'T: Use red as an accent everywhere
**Why:** Red is for warnings, over-use desensitizes
**Instead:** Reserve red for true destructive/warning actions

### ❌ DON'T: Ignore contrast ratios
**Why:** Violates accessibility, excludes users
**Instead:** Test all color combinations with WebAIM contrast checker

### ❌ DON'T: Make different features different colors
**Why:** No visual hierarchy, confusing
**Instead:** Use color strategically (blue = primary, green = achieved)

### ❌ DON'T: Use color alone to convey meaning
**Why:** Colorblind users excluded
**Instead:** Use color + icon + text for clarity

## Color Accessibility Testing

### Before shipping any color changes:

```
WCAG CONTRAST TESTING

1. Use WebAIM Contrast Checker (webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

2. Test these combinations:
   ✓ All text colors on all background colors
   ✓ Light mode: Text on primary, secondary, card backgrounds
   ✓ Dark mode: Text on all dark backgrounds
   ✓ Button text on button background colors
   ✓ Icon colors on backgrounds

3. Minimum standards:
   - Normal text: 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
   - Large text (18pt+): 3:1 (WCAG AA)
   - Target: 7:1+ (WCAG AAA)

4. Test with:
   - Color Blindness Simulator (Coblis)
   - Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
   - High contrast mode on device

5. Document results:
   Color A (#XXX) on Color B (#XXX): Ratio 5.2:1 ✓ WCAG AA
```

### Design Implementation Steps

1. **Import Colors.ts** in all components
2. **Use color constants** - never hardcode hex values
3. **Add comments** explaining color choice
4. **Test contrast** on actual devices
5. **Verify dark mode** - colors readable on dark backgrounds
6. **Document decisions** in code

### Team Communication

- Share this document with design and development team
- Reference STEP 1 positioning when discussing colors
- Use "color psychology" language (not arbitrary aesthetic)
- Measure against the 4 core values: Reverence, Accessibility, Beauty, Growth
